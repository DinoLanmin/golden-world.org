Hello, dear world! After the time that went into preparation and setup, I am finally glad to launch the Golden World website!
The site is still in progress, I continue to adjust it for myself, I use the ready Jekyll theme Chirpy.
For me it is new, so it will take time, but I am sure, the site will become better with every update.

## About me
I am Linik Katon, a beginner writer, a bit of a philosopher, I like to create different things, and now I set myself the goal to make a website.
I cannot boast perfect knowledge of English language at the moment, but I am actively learning.
I planned for a long time to create my own place on the internet, and finally it happened. 
Especially now, after long time of writing and editing, I am preparing my first small book for self-publishing.
I hope its small edition will inspire me to be even more active, and to make writing stories and books my constant occupation.

This is a little about me. Let’s talk a little about the website and my plans.

## About the site
The site has already been launched several times, I was searching for the ideal option for its start. Now it seems I reached stability.
I made a small logo, which became the sign of this site, but maybe it will change in the future. For now there is not much written here, but in the coming time I will fill its sections and prepare new articles for publishing.
In general, I plan to work on the site’s color design, making it more in my style, in the style of an old study, or something like that.

## My plans
Everyone wants to make their site, their project, a special place, though I myself do not yet know exactly what that means.
I surely plan the following things, but how long they will take, I cannot even imagine:

Improve the site:
1.1 Improve the style
1.2 Fill the site with content
1.3 Develop what is necessary
1.4 Redesign the logo

Finish the book:
2.1 Finish writing
2.2 Publish

Develop next plans:
3.1 Really? Do I need next plans?

## Words of thanks
Thank you very much, if you already read this.
I do not yet know how successful it can be, at least workable, to create a site and keep it just as a separate place, we will see.
I am very grateful to the creator of this wonderful theme.
There were many themes I looked through, but besides writing I have a technical side, so I needed something more complex.

That is all for today — more is coming!  

Have a good time!

In general, this is what I have decided for now.
